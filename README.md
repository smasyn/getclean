Repository containing the submission for Module 3 Getting and Cleaning data

How it works
============
1. In your home directory create the subsdirector ./Coursera/Module 3/Project, where the data from the assigment will be loaded
2. Load the UCI HAR data indicated as indicated in the assignment, the subdirectory Project should now have a subdir UCI HAR Dataset, with two subdirs train and test, respectively for the train and test data
3. set your working directory to the home directory
4. run the script, q <- run_analysis()
5. the output table q is the tidy data set
6. write the tidy data set with write.csv(q,"q.csv)
 
Code book
=========
the variables are named <activity>.<subjectid>, where

o <activity> is the label of the activity, with possible values: LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
o <subject> is the subject identification with possible values: 1 to 30

the observations are the means and standard deviations of the parameters or features of the accelerometers
o tBodyAcc-XYZ
o tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

A cell represents the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Steps in the script
===================
make sure the working directory is your home directory

read activity labels and features, i.e. variable names
al vector representing activity labels
ft vector representing features

read train set data
trgst vector representing subject train data
trgxt vector representing x train data
trgyt vector representing y train data

read test set data
tstst vector representing subject test data
tstxt vector representing x test data
tstyt vector representing y test data
ject_test.txt")

merge train and test set data
st vector representing subject data
xt vector representing x data
yt vector representing y data

replace the activity values with descriptive activity labels
ytl is a vector where each number is replaced by its corresponding activity label using gsub

merge the data frames st, subject, x data and y data into one data frame called df

step meaningful dimension names
create vector co2, the second set of colum names derived from the features.txt table respresenting the column names
convert all to lowercase

create the row names by pasting "obs" with the row number, representing the observation number

create all, column names, the ID, followed by the features, follwed by the activity label

set meaningful dimension names

subset the data by...
creating a logical vector mn representing those column names where mean() is present as TRUE
creating a logical vector sd representing those column names where std() is present as TRUE
creating a logical vector mnsd representing ythose columns mean() or std()
the subset the data frame with the selected columns
do not forget to reinclude the Subject ID, column 1, and Activity Label, the last column

make a tidy data set
split the data set follwoing the activity label and the id

calculate the column Means but excluding the ID and Activity label column by only using columns 2 till 67
as ID is in the first column -1- and activity label in the last -68- 

this retuns the table q
